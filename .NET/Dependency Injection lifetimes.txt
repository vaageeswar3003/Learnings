Transient
=========
Transient objects are created each time they are requested.
This means that if a Transient is injected into multiple consumers, each consumer will receive a separate instance of the object.

Scoped
======
Scoped objects are created once per request.
This means that if a Scoped is injected into multiple consumers within the same request, they will all receive the same instance of this object.
However, if the object is injected into multiple consumers in different requests, each request will receive its own instance of the object.

Singleton
=========
Singleton objects are created the first time they are requested, and the same instance is used for all subsequent requests.
This can be useful if you want to ensure that all consumers of a service are using the same instance of the object.
