In C# there are 5 access specifiers for class members
======================================================
1. public ---> Accessible from anywhere.
2. protected ---> Accessible only from the child classes and within the class.
3. internal ---> Accessible from any class either child or not, but only within the same project.
4. internal protected ---> If from a class  the internal and protected members are accessible, then internal protected members are also 
                           accessible. These methods can be accessed from child classes across all projects as well as the classes within
                           the same project.
5. private ---> These are only accessible  within the class.
