Enum is user defined data type
It is better to decalre it under a namespace rather than a class
Enum stands for enumeration
Enums are constants which holds integers or string values.
It is a value type data type. That means unlike class in C# it is not reference type.
Structures in C# are also value type data type.

Syntax
=======

[<Modifier>] enum <Name> : <type>
{
    // List of named constant values
}

--> By default type is "int"
namespace example {
    enum Days {
        Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday
    }
    class Test {
        public static void Main() {
            Days d = 0;
            Days d1 = (Days)1;
            int thursdayAsInt = (int)Days.Thursday;
            Console.WriteLine(d+" "+d1+" "+thursdayAsInt); // Output --> Monday Tuesday 3
        }
    }
}

--> The reason for type casting is only 0 index can be recognized.
