"Git merge" will merge the code of source branch into the target branch.

For ex:  Initially we have main branch in the repository, later to develop a new feature we have created feature1 branch from main branch.
         Now, few commits were made in the feature1 branch and is ready to merge. 
         To complete this process, first we need to checkout to the main branch which is also the destination branch in this case. 
         Later, we need to give the command "git merge <source_branch_name>". 
         Now, we have the code of source branch in the current branch.

There are 2 types of merge.
     1. Fast forward merge
     2. Recursive merge

Fast forward merge
     -> If the destination  branch has no commits after the source branch is created, then the HEAD of destination branch will be moved to the HEAD position of source 
        branch.
Recursive merge
     -> If the destination branch has made some commits after the source branch is created, then the prompt asks to create a new commit, so that the HEAD of source and
        destination branches will point to the new commit created.
