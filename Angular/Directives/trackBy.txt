--> In *ngFor structural directive, whenever we change the reference of the array, the DOM will re-render.
--> But, if the data in array is very huge then it will impact the UI response.
--> To handle this situation Angualar has introduced trackBy feature, which helps to track the previous elements. So, that whenver the array
    is updated, then only the DOM of new elements will be updated instead of entire DOM.

Example
=======

app.component.html
------------------

<div *ngFor="let employee of employees; trackBy: refreshEmployees"></div>
<button (click)="onAddEmployee()"> 

app.component.ts
----------------

ngOnInit() {
    this.employees = [{id:1,name:'Raju'},{id:2,name:'Ravi'}];
}

onAddEmployee() {
    this.employees = [...this.employees, {id: 3,name: 'Rahul'}];
}

refreshEmployees(index: number, employee: any | IEmployee): number {
    return employee.id;
}

Explanation
===========

--> refreshEmployees() is the function that is passed to trackBy. This function takes to parameters.
1. index 2. The object
--> It returns the unique key of the object.
